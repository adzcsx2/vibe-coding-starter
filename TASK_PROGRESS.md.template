# Task Progress Tracking

> **Important**: This file is maintained by the coordinator. All roles must synchronize task status in real-time.
>
> **Update Rules**: Any status change must be immediately updated in this file and reported to the coordinator.

## 📋 Task List

| ID | Task Description | Assigned To | Status | Assigned Time | Completed Time | Progress | Notes |
|----|-----------------|-------------|--------|---------------|----------------|----------|-------|
| - | Example: Design System Architecture | architect | ⏳ Pending | - | - | 0% | Waiting to start |

## 🎯 Status Legend

- ⏳ **Pending** - Task created, waiting for assignment
- 🔄 **In Progress** - Task is being executed
- 🧪 **Testing** - **Coder tasks only**: Development complete, waiting for test validation
- ⏸️ **Blocked** - Task encountered obstacles, needs coordination
- ✅ **Completed** - Task finished and validated
- ❌ **Cancelled** - Task cancelled, no longer executing

### ⚠️ Special Note: Coder Task Status Flow

```
Coder Task Flow:
⏳ Pending → 🔄 In Progress → 🧪 Testing → ✅ Completed
                                   ↓ (test found issues)
                              🔄 In Progress (fix) → 🧪 Testing
```

**Mandatory Rules**:
- After coder completes development, must mark as "🧪 Testing"
- Coordinator receives notification, immediately assigns test for validation
- Only after test validation passes can it be marked as "✅ Completed"
- If test finds issues, returns to "🔄 In Progress" status for fixes

## 🔄 Context Recovery Guide

> After using `/clear` to clean context, follow these steps to recover:

1. **Read this file**: Understand current task progress
2. **Check in-progress tasks**: Find your ongoing tasks
3. **Read related documents**: architecture.md, game-design-document.md, etc.
4. **Report status**: Confirm current work status with coordinator

**Recovery Template**:
```
I have cleared my context. According to TASK_PROGRESS.md:
- Current Task ID: [ID]
- Task Description: [Description]
- Current Progress: [Percentage]%
- Last Operation: [Time] [Operation]
Please confirm if I should continue executing this task.
```
